# Obstacle Avoidance using Dynamic Movement Primitives and Reinforcement Learning

In this repository: 
- code for generating datasets and neural network models for obstacle avoidance trajectories using DMPs and PIÂ²
- code for applying the 3P-2D model in a pick-and-drop task in simulation using ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo 11 Classic
- models and datasets presented in the paper
- pdf with more details about the simulation experiments
- video of the data generation of the four example models and the corresponding simulated and real experiments
